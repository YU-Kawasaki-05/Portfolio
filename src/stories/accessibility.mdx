# Accessibility Guidelines

This documentation covers accessibility standards and testing for our component library.

## Overview

Our components are built with accessibility in mind, following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines. We use automated testing with the `@storybook/addon-a11y` to catch accessibility issues during development.

## Key Accessibility Features

### Color Contrast
- All text meets WCAG AA color contrast requirements
- Interactive elements have sufficient contrast in all states (hover, focus, disabled)
- Colors are not the only way to convey information

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators are visible and clear
- Tab order follows logical reading flow
- Custom keyboard shortcuts follow standard conventions

### Screen Reader Support
- Proper semantic HTML elements are used
- ARIA labels and descriptions are provided where needed
- Live regions announce dynamic content changes
- Form controls have associated labels

### Focus Management
- Focus is managed properly in interactive components
- Focus traps work correctly in modals and dropdowns
- Focus returns to appropriate elements when closing overlays

## Component-Specific Guidelines

### Buttons
- Use semantic `<button>` elements or proper ARIA roles
- Provide accessible names via text content or `aria-label`
- Support keyboard activation (Enter and Space keys)
- Clearly indicate disabled state to screen readers

### Cards
- Use appropriate heading hierarchy within cards
- Provide `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` for complex cards
- Ensure interactive cards are keyboard accessible
- Group related content logically

### Badges
- Use `role="status"` for status indicators
- Include `aria-live` regions for dynamic badge updates
- Provide descriptive text for icon-only badges
- Ensure color is not the only indicator

## Testing

### Automated Testing
Our Storybook setup includes automated accessibility testing:
- WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA compliance
- Color contrast validation
- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader compatibility checks

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate entire interface using only keyboard
- [ ] Test with screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Verify focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Check color contrast in all states
- [ ] Test with zoom up to 200%
- [ ] Validate with users who have disabilities

### Browser Testing
Test accessibility across different browsers and assistive technologies:
- Chrome with ChromeVox
- Firefox with NVDA
- Safari with VoiceOver
- Edge with Narrator

## Best Practices

### Development
1. Use semantic HTML elements when possible
2. Add ARIA attributes only when semantic HTML isn't sufficient
3. Test early and often with real assistive technologies
4. Include accessibility considerations in design reviews

### Design
1. Ensure sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
2. Design clear focus indicators
3. Provide multiple ways to convey information (not just color)
4. Consider cognitive load and reading complexity

### Content
1. Write clear, descriptive link and button text
2. Use proper heading hierarchy
3. Provide alternative text for images
4. Write content at appropriate reading level

## Accessibility Testing Tools

### Automated Tools
- Storybook a11y addon (built-in)
- axe DevTools browser extension
- Lighthouse accessibility audit
- WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator

### Screen Readers
- **Windows**: NVDA (free), JAWS
- **macOS**: VoiceOver (built-in)
- **Linux**: Orca (built-in with GNOME)
- **Mobile**: TalkBack (Android), VoiceOver (iOS)

## Reporting Issues

When you find accessibility issues:
1. Document the specific problem
2. Include steps to reproduce
3. Note which assistive technology was affected
4. Suggest potential solutions
5. Assign appropriate priority level

Remember: Accessibility is not a featureâ€”it's a fundamental requirement for inclusive web experiences.
